This walkthrough demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt content. The code examples are designed for a Windows Forms application. 
This application does not demonstrate real world scenarios, such as using smart cards. 
Instead, it demonstrates the fundamentals of encryption and decryption.
This walkthrough uses the following guidelines for encryption:
Use the RijndaelManaged class, a symmetric algorithm, to encrypt and decrypt data by using its automatically generated Key and IV.
Use the RSACryptoServiceProvider, an asymmetric algorithm, to encrypt and decrypt the key to the data encrypted by RijndaelManaged. 
Asymmetric algorithms are best used for smaller amounts of data, such as a key.
Represents the padding modes to be used for encryption or decryption.
